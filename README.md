# Unit 13 Homework Assignment - AWS Lambda & Lex Bot Creation



## Robo Advisor for Retirement Plans
In this project, I performed the following tasks:

1. Initial Robo Advisor Configuration: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation to gather requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. Build and Test the Robo Advisor: Ensure the bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.

3. Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function: Code and Create an Amazon Lambda function, using python, that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.
